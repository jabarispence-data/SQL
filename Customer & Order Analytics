#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.FebSales LIMIT 5;

#1. How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT "" AND orderID != 'OrderID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND orderID IS NOT ""
AND orderID != 'OrderID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT BIT_DB.JanSales.Product
, MIN(BIT_DB.JanSales.price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT ROUND(price*SUM(Quantity),2) AS revenue
, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID != 'OrderID'
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product
, Quantity
, price*SUM(Quantity) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '548 Lincoln%'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(acctnum)
, AVG(price*Quantity) average_spent
FROM BIT_DB.customers Cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON Cust.order_ID = Feb.orderID
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID != 'OrderID';
