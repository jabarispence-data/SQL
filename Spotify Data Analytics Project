# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. Which artists appear most frequently in the Top 50 songs, and how many songs does each of those artists have on the list?

SELECT artist_name
, COUNT(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(track_name) desc; 

#2. What is the average popularity score for songs in the dataset, and which artists have an average popularity above that overall average?
SELECT AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > (SELECT AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata)
;

#3. Which artists have more than one song with popularity above 85, and how many qualifying songs does each artist have?
SELECT artist_name
, COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 85
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT (*) > 1;
 
#4. Which songs have both above-average popularity and above-average danceability?

SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > (SELECT AVG(popularity) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata)
AND danceability > (SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata);

#5. Group the songs by energy rating, and which artists contribute to the songs in the high category?

SELECT COUNT(*)
, CASE 
WHEN energy > 0.75 THEN 'high'
WHEN energy > 0.50 THEN 'above_avg'
WHEN energy > 0.25 THEN 'below_avg'
ELSE 'bad'
END AS 'energy_rating'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY CASE 
WHEN energy > 0.75 THEN 'high'
WHEN energy > 0.50 THEN 'above_avg'
WHEN energy > 0.25 THEN 'below_avg'
ELSE 'bad'
END;

SELECT artist_name
,  track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy > 0.75;
